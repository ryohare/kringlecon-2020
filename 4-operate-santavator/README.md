# Objective 4 - Operate the Santavator 
The santavator requires powering the 3 colors power sources, yellow, red and green via a single stream of elections. Items are acquired by exploring the areas around Santa's castle which can be used to manipulate the stream. Once enough items are acquired, they can be used to manipulate the electron stream in such a way that all 3 sources are powered.
